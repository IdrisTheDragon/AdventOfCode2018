--- Part Two ---
After a very long time, the water spring will run dry. How much water will be retained?

In the example above, water that won't eventually drain out is shown as ~, a total of 29 tiles.

How many water tiles are left after the water spring stops producing water and all remaining water not at rest has drained?
